# OAP Release Cadence

Starting with OAP 1.1.0, OAP project follows the semantic versioning guidelines with a few deviations. These small differences account for OAPâ€™s nature as a multi-module project.

#### OAP Versions

Each OAP release will be versioned: [MAJOR].[FEATURE].[MAINTENANCE]

#### Release Cadence

In general, major feature releases occur about every 4 months. Hence, OAP would generally be released about 4 months after 1.1.0. Maintenance releases happen as needed in between feature releases. Major releases do not happen according to a fixed schedule.
