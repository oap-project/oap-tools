ExecutionPlanParser reads a json file representing a physical plan, identifies dataTypes, expressions and execution operators.

The code requires three files to be present in the same directory: GluttenSupportedExpression.List  GluttenSupportedOperator.List  TotalExpression.List
Make sure those files exist, and are accurately populated before running the code.
To compile make sure that java is installed on the system.


type: make
to run: java ExecutionPlanParser inputFile.json
